# Portfolio

This portfolio was created as a showcase demonstration of my various skills, not limited to software development but also creative writing and game developer background. This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Purpose

This portfolio functions as an online resume, designed to show off my strengths beyond what a simple CV can demonstrate. While this was built for a project as part of my software development diploma, it will continuously be expanded upon as I learn more skills and continue further into game development.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
